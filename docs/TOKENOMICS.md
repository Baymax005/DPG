## 📈 Token Economics

### Revenue Model
Platform generates revenue from:
1. Trading fees (0.5% per trade)
2. Withdrawal fees (0.5-1%)
3. Conversion fees (1%)
4. Premium features

### Token Value Drivers
1. **Fee Discounts** → More usage = More demand
2. **Staking Rewards** → Lock up supply = Scarcity
3. **Revenue Share** → Platform growth = Token growth
4. **Governance** → Community control = Value

### Burn Mechanism 🔥
To increase scarcity over time:
- **Quarterly Burn:** 10% of platform profits used to buy & burn $DPG
- **Trading Fee Burn:** 0.1% of every trade burned
- **Target:** Reduce supply to 500M tokens (50% reduction)
