## 💰 Token Utility (What $DPG Does)

### 1. **Fee Discounts** 💸
Hold $DPG to get reduced trading/withdrawal fees:

```
Fee Tier System:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ DPG Holdings    Trading Fee    Withdrawal Fee   │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 0 DPG          0.5%           1.0%              │
│ 1,000 DPG      0.4% (-20%)    0.8% (-20%)       │
│ 10,000 DPG     0.3% (-40%)    0.6% (-40%)       │
│ 50,000 DPG     0.2% (-60%)    0.4% (-60%)       │
│ 100,000+ DPG   0.1% (-80%)    0.2% (-80%)       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 2. **Staking Rewards** 🌾
Stake $DPG to earn passive income:
- **APY:** 5-15% (dynamic, based on platform revenue)
- **Lock Period:** Flexible (30/90/180 days)
- **Rewards:** Paid in $DPG + platform revenue share

**Where Rewards Come From:**
1. **Platform Revenue Share (70% of APY):**
   - 10% of all platform trading fees go to staking pool
   - 5% of withdrawal fees go to staking pool
   - Distributed proportionally to stakers based on lock period
   
2. **Reserved Staking Pool (30% of APY):**
   - 80M tokens allocated from "Reserve & Ecosystem" (8% of total supply)
   - Released gradually over 4 years to subsidize early staking
   - Not inflationary - comes from pre-allocated supply

**Reward Calculation Example:**
```
User stakes: 10,000 $DPG for 180 days
Total staked: 1,000,000 $DPG
Platform trading volume: $100K/day
Platform fees collected: $500/day (0.5%)
Staking pool share: $50/day (10% of fees)

Your daily reward = (10,000 / 1,000,000) × $50 = $0.50/day
Yearly: $0.50 × 365 = $182.50
APY: ($182.50 / $100) = ~8-12% (varies with volume)
```

**Lock Period Multipliers:**
- 30 days: 1.0x rewards (base APY)
- 90 days: 1.25x rewards (+25% bonus)
- 180 days: 1.5x rewards (+50% bonus)

### 3. **Governance** 🗳️
Vote on platform decisions:
- New currency listings
- Fee structure changes
- Feature prioritization
- Treasury allocation

**Voting Power:** 1 $DPG = 1 Vote

**Governance Scope - What You Actually Control:**

1. **Fee Structure (High Impact):**

   - Withdrawal fee percentage (0.1% - 2.0% range)
   - Conversion fee percentage (0.5% - 2.0% range)
   - Vote required: >50% approval, 100K $DPG minimum quorum

2. **Currency Listings (Medium Impact):**
   - Add new crypto currencies (BTC, SOL, ADA, etc.)
   - Add new stablecoins (DAI, BUSD, etc.)
   - Remove underperforming currencies

   - Pause platform in case of exploit
   - Blacklist malicious addresses
   - Update smart contracts (via proxy)
   - Vote required: >80% approval, 1M $DPG quorum + multi-sig

**What Governance CANNOT Control (Hardcoded):**
- ❌ Mint new tokens (disabled forever)
- ❌ Seize user funds
- ❌ Change total supply
- ❌ Rug pull or backdoor

**Proposal Process:**
1. Submit proposal (requires 10K $DPG stake)
2. 3-day discussion period
3. 7-day voting period
4. 48-hour timelock before execution
5. Multi-sig verification for critical changes

**Delegation:**

## 🚀 Launch Plan & Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (Q1 2026)
- [ ] Smart contract development
- [ ] Security audit (CertiK/OpenZeppelin)
- [ ] Tokenomics finalization
- [ ] Legal compliance check

### Phase 2: Testnet Launch (Q2 2026)
- [ ] Deploy on Sepolia testnet
- [ ] Community testing
- [ ] Bug bounty program
- [ ] Whitepaper release

### Phase 3: Fair Launch (Q3 2026)
- [ ] Mainnet deployment (Ethereum + Polygon)
- [ ] Initial liquidity provision
- [ ] Uniswap listing
- [ ] Community airdrop #1 (10M tokens)

**Anti-Dump Mechanisms (Prevent Immediate Selling):**

#### 1. Airdrop Vesting (Prevents Instant Dumps)
**Problem:** Users claim airdrop and sell immediately → price crashes

**Solution: Gradual Unlock**
```
Airdrop received: 1,000 $DPG
Month 1: 25% unlocked (250 $DPG available)
Month 2: 25% unlocked (500 $DPG total)
Month 3: 25% unlocked (750 $DPG total)
Month 4: 25% unlocked (1,000 $DPG total - fully vested)
```

**Implementation:**
- Smart contract holds airdrop tokens
- Users can claim 25% monthly
- Unclaimed tokens auto-unlock over time
- Can stake locked tokens immediately (earn rewards while vesting)

#### 2. Liquidity Lock (Prevents Rug Pull)
**Problem:** Team provides liquidity, then removes it → price to $0

**Solution: Time-Locked Liquidity**
```
Initial liquidity: $50K ETH + $50K $DPG
Lock period: 2 years (minimum)
Lock contract: Team Finance or Unicrypt
Proof: Lock transaction on Etherscan

Cannot be withdrawn until: Q3 2028
Even by team - smart contract enforced
```

**What Gets Locked:**
- 100% of initial Uniswap LP tokens
- 50% of DEX liquidity for 2 years
- 50% of DEX liquidity for 1 year (staggered unlock)

#### 3. Trading Limits (Early Days)
**First 30 Days After Launch:**
- Max sell per transaction: 10,000 $DPG (~1% of liquidity)
- Max sell per wallet per day: 50,000 $DPG
- No limits on buying
- Limits auto-remove after 30 days via time-lock

**Why?**
- Prevents whales from dumping entire allocation at once
- Gives organic price discovery time
- Protects early community members
- Industry standard for fair launches

#### 4. Staking Incentives (Encourages Holding)
**Launch Week Bonus:**
- Stake within first 7 days: 2x rewards for first month
- Lock for 180 days at launch: 3x rewards
- Example: 15% APY becomes 45% APY if staked early + long lock

**Why It Works:**
- Incentivizes holding instead of selling
- Removes tokens from circulating supply
- Aligns long-term holders with project success

### Phase 4: Growth (Q4 2026)
- [ ] CEX listings (Gate.io, MEXC)
- [ ] Staking platform launch
- [ ] Governance system activation
- [ ] Trading rewards program

## �📈 Token Economics

### Revenue Model
Platform generates revenue from:
1. Trading fees (0.5% per trade)
2. Withdrawal fees (0.5-1%)
3. Conversion fees (1%)
4. Premium features

### Token Value Drivers
1. **Fee Discounts** → More usage = More demand
2. **Staking Rewards** → Lock up supply = Scarcity
3. **Revenue Share** → Platform growth = Token growth
4. **Governance** → Community control = Value

### Burn Mechanism 🔥
To increase scarcity over time:
- **Quarterly Burn:** 10% of platform profits used to buy & burn $DPG
- **Trading Fee Burn:** 0.1% of every trade burned
- **Target:** Reduce supply to 500M tokens (50% reduction)

**Detailed Burn Specifications:**

#### 1. Trading Fee Burn (Per-Transaction)
**How it works:**
- Every trade on DPG platform charges 0.5% fee
- Of that 0.5%, we take 0.1% and burn it
- Burned tokens sent to `0x000...dead` address (unrecoverable)
- Happens automatically via smart contract
- **No human intervention required**

**Example:**
```
User trades $1,000 worth of ETH
Trading fee: $5 (0.5%)
Burn amount: $1 (0.1% of trade, or 20% of fee)
Remaining fee: $4 goes to platform

At $DPG = $0.10:
Tokens burned: 10 $DPG
Happens automatically on every trade
```

**On-Chain Tracking:**
- Every burn emits event: `TokenBurned(amount, txHash, timestamp)`
- Public dashboard shows: total burned, burn rate, remaining supply
- Anyone can verify burns on Etherscan

#### 2. Quarterly Revenue Burn (Manual via Multi-Sig)
**How it works:**
- Every 3 months (Jan 1, Apr 1, Jul 1, Oct 1)
- Calculate platform profit = Revenue - Expenses
- Use 10% of profit to buy $DPG from market
- Burn purchased tokens immediately
- **Requires 3-of-5 multi-sig approval** (safer at launch)

**Process:**
1. **Calculate Profit:** Finance team publishes quarterly report
2. **Governance Vote:** Community votes to approve burn amount (50% threshold)
3. **Buy from Market:** DEX purchase over 7 days (avoid price spike)
4. **Multi-Sig Execution:** 3 of 5 signers approve burn transaction
5. **Public Announcement:** Blog post + on-chain proof published

**Example Q1 2027:**
```
Revenue: $500,000
Expenses: $300,000
Profit: $200,000
Burn budget: $20,000 (10% of profit)

$DPG price: $0.50
Tokens to buy: 40,000 $DPG
Burn date: April 5, 2027
Multi-sig: 0xABC...123
Tx hash: 0xDEF...456
```

**Why Manual (Not Automatic)?**
- Early stage: need flexibility for emergencies
- Can adjust % based on market conditions
- Governance approval adds transparency
- After Year 2: can switch to automatic via DAO vote

#### 3. Burn Tracking Dashboard
**Live Metrics (Updated Real-Time):**
- Total Supply Remaining: 1,000,000,000 → ???
- Tokens Burned (All-Time): ???
- Burn Rate (7-day average): ??? $DPG/day
- Quarterly Burns Completed: 0 / 16 (4-year plan)
- Next Scheduled Burn: Date + estimated amount
- Burn Wallet Address: `0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD`

**Transparency:**
- All burn transactions publicly visible
- Monthly burn reports published
- Smart contract verified on Etherscan
- No one can reverse burns (tokens permanently destroyed)

## 🛡️ Security & Compliance

### Smart Contract Security
- ✅ Audited by CertiK/OpenZeppelin
- ✅ Multi-sig wallet for treasury
- ✅ Time-locked admin functions
- ✅ Emergency pause mechanism
- ✅ No owner minting (fixed supply)

### Legal Compliance
- ⚠️ **Not a Security:** Utility token only
- ✅ Fair launch (no pre-sale)
- ✅ Transparent tokenomics
- ✅ KYC for large holders (if required)
- ✅ Legal opinion obtained

**KYC Thresholds (Compliance):**

To prevent money laundering and comply with regulations:

**Tier 1: No KYC Required**
- Holdings: <100,000 $DPG (~$10K at $0.10)
- Trading: <$10,000/month
- Staking: Any amount
- Voting: Full rights

**Tier 2: Basic KYC Required**
- Holdings: 100,000 - 1,000,000 $DPG ($10K - $100K)
- Trading: $10,000 - $100,000/month
- Requirements: Email + Phone verification
- Verification time: Instant (automated)

**Tier 3: Enhanced KYC Required**
- Holdings: >1,000,000 $DPG (>$100K value)
- Trading: >$100,000/month
- Requirements: 
  - Government ID (passport/driver's license)
  - Proof of address (utility bill <3 months)
  - Selfie verification
  - Source of funds declaration (if >$500K)
- Verification time: 24-48 hours (manual review)
- Provider: Sumsub or Onfido (industry standard)

**Why These Thresholds?**
- Most retail users (<$10K) = no friction
- Institutional users (>$100K) = regulatory compliance
- Prevents whales from manipulating governance anonymously
- Required for major exchange listings (Binance, Coinbase)

**Geographic Restrictions:**
- ❌ Banned: USA, China, North Korea, Iran (regulatory uncertainty)
- ⚠️ Restricted: Requires local legal opinion before launch
- ✅ Allowed: EU, UK, Canada, Singapore, UAE (crypto-friendly)
- Subject to change based on regulations

### Risk Disclosure
- ⚠️ Crypto investments are risky
- ⚠️ No guaranteed returns
- ⚠️ Value may fluctuate
- ⚠️ Do your own research (DYOR)

## 🧪 Why Testnet First?

**Testnet deployment is CRITICAL before mainnet launch. Here's why:**

### Benefits of Testnet Deployment:
1. **FREE Testing** - No real money required, use testnet ETH from faucets
2. **Bug Detection** - Find and fix smart contract bugs before mainnet
3. **Security Testing** - Test for vulnerabilities without financial risk
4. **User Feedback** - Let community test features and provide feedback
5. **Gas Optimization** - Optimize contract to minimize mainnet costs
6. **Integration Testing** - Test token with DPG platform thoroughly

### Testnet vs Mainnet:

| Feature | Testnet (Sepolia) | Mainnet (Ethereum) |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Cost** | FREE (testnet ETH) | Real ETH ($$$) |
| **Risk** | Zero | High |
| **Mistakes** | Can redeploy anytime | Permanent |
| **Testing** | Unlimited | Expensive |
| **Users** | Developers only | Real users |
| **Value** | No real value | Real money |

### Deployment Timeline:

```
Nov 6-8, 2025: Testnet (Sepolia)
    ↓ Test everything
    ↓ Fix bugs
    ↓ Get feedback
Nov 15-30: Security Audit ($1000-5000)
    ↓ Professional review
    ↓ Fix critical issues
    ↓ Penetration testing
Q1 2026: Mainnet Launch (REAL)
    ↓ Deploy audited contract
    ↓ Fair launch
    ↓ Community airdrop
```

**Never skip testnet!** Most crypto hacks happen because projects rushed to mainnet without proper testing.
