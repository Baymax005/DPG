## 📈 Token Economics

### Revenue Model
Platform generates revenue from:
1. Trading fees (0.5% per trade)
2. Withdrawal fees (0.5-1%)
3. Conversion fees (1%)
4. Premium features

### Token Value Drivers
1. **Fee Discounts** → More usage = More demand
2. **Staking Rewards** → Lock up supply = Scarcity
3. **Revenue Share** → Platform growth = Token growth
4. **Governance** → Community control = Value

### Burn Mechanism 🔥
To increase scarcity over time:
- **Quarterly Burn:** 10% of platform profits used to buy & burn $DPG
- **Trading Fee Burn:** 0.1% of every trade burned
- **Target:** Reduce supply to 500M tokens (50% reduction)

## 🧪 Why Testnet First?

**Testnet deployment is CRITICAL before mainnet launch. Here's why:**

### Benefits of Testnet Deployment:
1. **FREE Testing** - No real money required, use testnet ETH from faucets
2. **Bug Detection** - Find and fix smart contract bugs before mainnet
3. **Security Testing** - Test for vulnerabilities without financial risk
4. **User Feedback** - Let community test features and provide feedback
5. **Gas Optimization** - Optimize contract to minimize mainnet costs
6. **Integration Testing** - Test token with DPG platform thoroughly

### Testnet vs Mainnet:

| Feature | Testnet (Sepolia) | Mainnet (Ethereum) |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Cost** | FREE (testnet ETH) | Real ETH ($$$) |
| **Risk** | Zero | High |
| **Mistakes** | Can redeploy anytime | Permanent |
| **Testing** | Unlimited | Expensive |
| **Users** | Developers only | Real users |
| **Value** | No real value | Real money |

### Deployment Timeline:

```
Nov 6-8, 2025: Testnet (Sepolia)
    ↓ Test everything
    ↓ Fix bugs
    ↓ Get feedback
Nov 15-30: Security Audit ($1000-5000)
    ↓ Professional review
    ↓ Fix critical issues
    ↓ Penetration testing
Q1 2026: Mainnet Launch (REAL)
    ↓ Deploy audited contract
    ↓ Fair launch
    ↓ Community airdrop
```

**Never skip testnet!** Most crypto hacks happen because projects rushed to mainnet without proper testing.
