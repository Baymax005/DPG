### ðŸŽ‰ Major Release: Real Blockchain Integration

- **Real Blockchain Transactions** - Send actual testnet ETH on Sepolia network
- **Sync Balance Button** - Fetch real-time balance from blockchain
- **Delete Wallet** - Remove wallets with zero balance

- **Gas Fee Estimation** - Accurate gas cost calculation before sending
- **Transaction Hash Tracking** - Store and display tx_hash for Etherscan verification
- **Encrypted Private Key Storage** - Fernet encryption for wallet security

### Changed
- **Removed Fake Deposits** - No more simulation, only real blockchain operations
- **Removed Fake Withdrawals** - Cleaned up mock transaction system
- **Updated `/send` Endpoint** - Now uses user's wallet private key instead of master wallet
- **Balance Validation** - Check real blockchain balance before sending
- **Transfer UI** - Now only shows "Send Crypto" (removed fake deposit/withdraw buttons)
- **Wallet Display** - Shows blockchain address with copy-friendly format

### Fixed
- **API URL Routing** - Fixed 404 errors for sync and delete endpoints (added `/api/v1` prefix)
- **Private Key Validation** - Proper format checking (0x + 64 hex characters)
- **Bcrypt Compatibility** - Downgraded to bcrypt 4.2.0 for passlib compatibility
- **PostgreSQL Setup** - Created dpg_user and dpg_payment_gateway database
- **Virtual Environment** - Fixed corrupted venv, created fresh venv_new with all dependencies
- **Balance Display** - Shows 4 decimal places for better precision

### Security
- Private keys encrypted with Fernet before database storage
- Never expose private keys in API responses
- Environment variables for sensitive data (Infura key, database password)
- JWT authentication for all API endpoints
- Testnet-only operations (no real money at risk)

### Technical Details
- **Backend**: FastAPI + SQLAlchemy + Web3.py 7.14.0 + PostgreSQL
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Blockchain**: Infura RPC provider + Sepolia testnet
- **Encryption**: Fernet (symmetric encryption) for private keys
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with encrypted wallet columns

### Dependencies Added

- eth-account==0.13.7

### Documentation

- Added step-by-step testing guide
- Documented API endpoints for import/sync/send
- Added troubleshooting section

### Known Issues
- bcrypt version warning (harmless, doesn't affect functionality)
